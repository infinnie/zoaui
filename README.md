# zoaui
ZoaUI, another UI library
##Disclaimers
* Remember to include all our files, especially, general.css before your own, so that your works would not get overridden.
* IE 8 or below would not support the responsive features, but no polyfixes would be provided here.
* We aim a modular approach here, and therefore all classnames are prefixed with zo-, which might increase the bytes used in writing your own HTML, and please do not prefix your own classnames with zo-.
* We are considering following the BEM conventions and therefore the classnames might seem martian some day.
